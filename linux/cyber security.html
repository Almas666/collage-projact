    <p> In today’s age of computers cryptography is often associated with the process where an ordinary plain text is converted to cipher text which is the text made such that intended receiver of the text can only decode it and hence this process is known as encryption. The process of conversion of cipher text to plain text this is known as decryption. </p>

    <p>Supply chain risk management, by definition, is the process by which organizations take action to identify, assess and mitigate the risks they face within their entire supply chain. TechTarget describes supply chain risk management (SCRM) as: 'The coordinated efforts of an organization to help identify, monitor, detect and mitigate threats to supply chain continuity and profitability.'  </p>

    <p>IoT security is the technology segment focused on safeguarding connected devices and networks in the internet of things (IoT). IoT involves adding internet connectivity to a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals and/or people. Each "thing" is provided a unique identifier and the ability to automatically transfer data over a network. Allowing devices to connect to the internet opens them up to a number of serious vulnerabilities if they are not properly protected.</p>
